# Financial Data Extraction and Analysis for Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla (2021-2023)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs financial data extraction, analysis, and summary reporting for three major tech companies—Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla—over the fiscal years 2021 to 2023.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to compute and analyze the growth rates of key financial metrics such as revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow for the selected companies. The analysis is intended to provide insights into the financial performance and trends of these companies.
